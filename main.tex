% ABSTRACT

\begin{abstract}
Historically, the inter-domain routing security had to be established based on trust, due to poorly designed BGP protocol. This approach is insufficient, as seen in practice numerous times.
To prevent this, new kind of security measures were proposed and are needed to be implemented on Internet's majority AS'es.
%\\

This article covers the current threat landscape and taxonomy of attack vectors on routing layer, as well as current and new protective measures with theirs future development plans and caveats.

However, due to current system design, the protection is based on mutual protection. This causes the chicken or the egg problem. Author will try to explain slow adoption rate.

% FIRST section - INTRODUCTION

\section{Introduction to routing security}

\IEEEPARstart{A}{utonomous Systems} (ASes) are main, essential entity in today's Internet. As defined in \cite{rfc1930},
"an AS is a connected group of one or more IP prefixes run by one or more network operators which has a SINGLE and CLEARLY DEFINED routing policy".
When routing policy is configured and accepted by adjacent ASes (peers) traffic is allowed to flow.

If a traffic is traversing in an unintended fashion (conflicting with the routing policy), one can call a \emph{routing incident}.
Detailed breakdown of incident types and enumeration of different scenarios is presented in section \ref{def:tax}.
Threat landscape and risk analysis are available in \ref{def:impact}.

There are well defined means of protection which mitigates impact for these attacks. Main division factor that should differentiate them is \emph{passive} -- traditionally used as basic BGP \emph{hygiene} intended for verifying the trust of a peer or traffic engineering tricks, and \emph{proactive} means -- new generation technologies that guarantee an incident will not happen. Both categories are described in sections \ref{protect:filtering} and \ref{protect:rov},\ref{protect:path}, respectively.

In section \ref{now:slow} author summarizes the RPKI implementation global progression and tries to give a prognosis on future efforts. To give complete view, section \ref{now:caveats} describes some unwanted scenarios and threat that RPKI introduces. The section \ref{now:future} provides the overview on future development directions.

Section \ref{conclusion} states author's conclusions.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}

Internet to dziki zachód ale robim co możem 

\begin{displayquote}
	In the Internet, routing announcements are accepted without almost any validation\\
	•This opens a possibility for a network operator to announce someone else's network prefixes without permission\\
	•The prefix may be announced with the same origin\\
	•The prefix may be leaked\\
	•A malicious operator can steal prefixes and blackhole them or intercept and modify traffic in transit\\
	•A good operator can also steal someone's network occasionally, by an error\\
	•A malicious employee of a good operator is then able to read and modify incoming traffic as well\\
	•Unauthorized access to operator's equipment can also be used for hijacking
