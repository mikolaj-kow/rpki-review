The document also discusses creation of ROAs for facilitating the use of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) mitigation services. Considerations related to ROAs and origin validation in the context of destination-based Remote Triggered Black Hole (RTBH) filtering are also highlighted.},

	abstract =	{This document formulates a plan of a phased transition to a state where RPKI repositories and Relying Party software performing RPKI Validation will use the RPKI Repository Delta Protocol (RRDP) {[}RFC8182{]} as the only mandatory to implement access protocol. In short this plan consists of the following phases. In phase 0, today's deployment, RRDP is supported by most, but not all Repositories, and most but not all RP software. In the proposed phase 1 RRDP will become mandatory to implement for Repositories, in addition to rsync. This phase can start as soon as this document is published. Once the proposed updates are implemented by all Repositories phase 2 will start. In this phase RRDP will become mandatory to implement for all RP software, and rsync must no longer be used. Measurements will need to be done to help determine when it will be safe to transition to the final phase of this plan. During this phase Repositories will no longer be required to provide rsync access for RPKI validation purposes. However, they may still provide rsync access for direct access to files for other purposes, if desired, at a best effort basis. Although this document currently includes descriptions and updates to RFCs for each of these phases, we may find that it will be beneficial to have separate documents for the plan, and each phase, so that it might be more clear to all when the updates to RFCs take effect.},

Frequent incidents that result in significant disruptions to Internet routing are labeled route leaks, but to date a common definition of the term has been lacking. This document provides a working definition of route leaks while keeping in mind the real occurrences that have received significant attention. Further, this document attempts to enumerate (though not exhaustively) different types of route leaks based on observed events on the Internet. The aim is to provide a taxonomy that covers several forms of route leaks that have been observed and are of concern to the Internet user community as well as the network operator community.},
